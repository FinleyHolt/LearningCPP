# Introduction

Hello, I am Finley Holt! I recently graduated from college and am looking to expand my technical horizons. To do this, I will be reading C++ Primer, documenting notes using Obsidian, and completing exercises in this repo.

My background is in aerospace and mechanical engineering, but I have always been intrigued by computers and coding. I have some experience with python, but really want to grow in learning syntax as well as algorithms.
